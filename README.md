# a3query-cog
An extension for discord.py bots to query info from Arma 3 servers. The command itself is very basic and you should make your own version of it. 

## Getting started
Before usage, change the default value for the server parameter to your preferred Arma 3 server. 

Install the requirements from the ``requirements.txt`` file and add the cog file ``a3_query.py`` to your discord.py bot by loading it in with other cogs at startup. 

You probably already have a system to automatically load cogs which are in a folder, but if you do not [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#discord.ext.commands.Bot.load_extension) is the documentation on how to load an extension with discord.py.
